      <h3>
        Fall in love with Cambodia
      </h3>
      
      <p><strong>Quick facts</strong>
      <br>
        Cambodia, country on the Indochinese mainland of Southeast Asia. Cambodia is largely a land of plains and great rivers and lies amid important overland and river trade routes linking China to India and Southeast Asia. The influences of many Asian cultures, alongside those of France and the United States, can be seen in the capital, Phnom Penh, one of a handful of urban centres in the largely rural country.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>Climate</strong>
      <br>
        Cambodia’s climate is governed by the monsoon winds, which define two major seasons. From mid-May to early October, the strong prevailing winds of the southwest monsoon bring heavy rains and high humidity. From early November to mid-March, the lighter and drier winds of the northeast monsoon bring variable cloudiness, infrequent precipitation, and lower humidity. The weather between these seasons is transitional.
      </p> 
      
      <p><strong>Cultural life</strong>
        <br>
         After Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953, the government placed particular emphasis on accelerating that revival. This coincided with the rapid expansion of primary and secondary school facilities and the emergence of education as the most important factor of social mobility. The leadership of Democratic Kampuchea, inspired in large part by the People’s Republic of China, subordinated culture to its own interpretations of Marxist-Leninist doctrines. The government in Phnom Penh after 1979, however, made serious efforts to restore such traditional forms of artistic expression as Cambodian classical music, ballet, and popular theatre.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>History</strong>
      <br>
        The historical importance of Cambodia in mainland Southeast Asia is out of proportion to its present reduced territory and limited political power. Between the 11th and 13th centuries, the Khmer (Cambodian) state included much of the Indochinese mainland, incorporating large parts of present-day southern Vietnam, Laos, and eastern Thailand. The cultural influence of Cambodia on other countries, particularly Laos and Thailand, has been enormous.

        Fall in love with Vietnam
      </h3>
      
      <p><strong>Quick facts</strong>
      <br>
        Tribal Viets inhabiting the Red River delta entered written history when China’s southward expansion reached them in the 3rd century BCE. From that time onward, a dominant theme of Vietnam’s history has been interaction with China, the source of most of Vietnam’s high culture. Vietnam has a long history of affiliating with a dominant civilization and adapting that civilization’s ideas, institutions, and technology to Vietnamese purposes. This pattern of affiliating and adapting was already evident in Vietnam’s historical relations with China, and it reappeared as descendants of mandarins responded to the challenge of the West by rejecting tradition and becoming communists to combat colonialism. The pattern was evident again as it animated 20th-century artistic movements that employed Western forms to promote social renovation; and since the 1980s it has been the driving force behind the Vietnam Communist Party’s embrace of economic liberalization and integration into the world economy. Such strategic absorption and adaptation have helped propel Vietnam to become one of the world’s most populous countries, with one of the most rapidly expanding market economies.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>Climate</strong>
      <br>
        The northern part of Vietnam is on the edge of the tropical climatic zone. During January, the coldest month of the year.The winter season in northern Vietnam lasts from November to April; from early February to the end of March there is a persistent drizzle, and March and April are sometimes considered to be a transitional period. The summer in northern Vietnam lasts from April or May to October and is characterized by heat, heavy rainfall, and occasional typhoons. In central and southern Vietnam the southwest monsoon winds between June and November bring rains and typhoons to the eastern slopes of the mountains and the lowland plains. The period between December and April is drier and is characterized by the winds of the northeast monsoon and, in the south, by high temperatures.
      </p> 
      
      <p><strong>Cultural life</strong>
        <br>
         Chinese influence permeated all aspects of traditional Vietnamese culture, while Western influences became strong in the 20th century. Since the loosening of economic and political controls in the late 1980s, Vietnam has experienced both increased exposure to the lifestyles of the capitalist world and a resurfacing of old cultural practices. Folk traditions such as shamanism and soothsaying have experienced a revival despite official disapproval.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>History</strong>
      <br>
        Relatively little is known about the origins of the Vietnamese. They first appeared in history as the so-called “Lac” peoples, who lived in the Red River delta region, in what is now northern Vietnam. Some scholars have suggested that the Lac were closely related to other peoples, known as the Viet (called the Yue by the Chinese), who inhabited the coastal region of East Asia from the Yangtze River to the Red River delta during the 1st millennium BCE. Others have questioned this view, noting that modern-day Vietnamese share many cultural and linguistic traits with other non-Chinese peoples living in neighbouring areas of Southeast Asia.

        Fall in love with Laos
      </h3>
      
      <p><strong>Quick facts</strong>
      <br>
        Laos, landlocked country of northeast-central mainland Southeast Asia. It consists of an irregularly round portion in the north that narrows into a peninsula-like region stretching to the southeast. Overall, the country extends about 650 miles (1,050 km) from northwest to southeast. The capital is Vientiane (Lao: Viangchan), located on the Mekong River in the northern portion of the country. The geologically diverse landscape of Laos, with its forested mountains, upland plateaus and lowland plains, supports an equally diverse population that is united largely through agriculture, particularly the cultivation of rice. Interactions—sometimes hostile, sometimes hospitable—with the neighbouring Khmer (Cambodian), Siamese (Thai), and Myanmar (Burmese) kingdoms between the 5th and the mid-19th century indirectly imbued Laos with elements of Indian culture, including Buddhism, the religion now practiced by most of the population. 
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>Climate</strong>
      <br>
        Laos has the typical tropical monsoon (wet-dry) climate of the region, though the mountains provide some variations in temperature. During the rainy season (May to October), the winds of the southwest monsoon deposit an average rainfall of 50 to 90 inches (1,300 to 2,300 mm), with totals reaching some 160 inches (4,100 mm) on the Bolovens Plateau. The dry season (November to April) is dominated by the northeast monsoon. Minimum temperatures average between 60 and 70 °F (16 and 21 °C) in the cool months of December through February, increasing to highs of more than 90 °F (32 °C) in March and April, just before the start of the rains. In the wet season the average temperature is 80 °F (27 °C).
      </p> 
      
      <p><strong>Cultural life</strong>
        <br>
        Among the lowland Lao, traditions of Buddhism and the boun (festival)—historically associated with village life but now also practiced in urban areas—guide everyday life. The merit-making ritual of giving alms to monks during their morning rounds, once discouraged by the government, has remained a prominent practice.

        Among the upland peoples, traditional rituals also persist, although some groups, such as the Hmong, do not feel the same attachment to the village as a spatial or social unit that the lowland Lao do. To the Hmong the primary foci of social identification are the household, the group of close relatives, and the clan, irrespective of any temporary or even permanent settlement. The Hmong cosmos is inhabited by a wide array of spirits, including medicine spirits, nature spirits, and shamanic spirits. Both social and spiritual life, then, vary markedly between the lowland and highland regions of Laos.

      <p><strong>History</strong>
      <br>
        This section focuses specifically on the history and development of the area and country now known as Laos. For a discussion of the history of Laos in its broader, regional context, see Southeast Asia, history of. The Lao people, the predominant ethnic group in present-day Laos, are a branch of the Tai peoples who by the 8th century CE had established a powerful kingdom, Nanzhao, in southwestern China. From Nanzhao the Tai gradually penetrated southward into the Southeast Asian mainland; their migration was accelerated in the 13th century by the Mongol invasions of southern China by Kublai Khan. The Lao, together with other Tai peoples, gradually supplanted various indigenous groups collectively known as Kha (“Slaves”). Since the 5th century these Kha communities had lived in what is now Laos under the suzerainty of the Khmer empire of Cambodia. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the Tai established the principality of Muong Swa (now Louangphrabang), which was ruled by various Tai leaders and the history of which survives in Laotian legend and myth.

      <h3>
        Fall in love with Indonesia
      </h3>
      
      <p><strong>Quick facts</strong>
      <br>
        Indonesia, country located off the coast of mainland Southeast Asia in the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is an archipelago that lies across the Equator and spans a distance equivalent to one-eighth of Earth’s circumference. Its islands can be grouped into the Greater Sunda Islands of Sumatra (Sumatera), Java (Jawa), the southern extent of Borneo (Kalimantan), and Celebes (Sulawesi); the Lesser Sunda Islands (Nusa Tenggara) of Bali and a chain of islands that runs eastward through Timor; the Moluccas (Maluku) between Celebes and the island of New Guinea; and the western extent of New Guinea (generally known as Papua). The capital, Jakarta, is located near the northwestern coast of Java. In the early 21st century Indonesia was the most populous country in Southeast Asia and the fourth most populous in the world. 
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>Climate</strong>
      <br>
        The climate of Indonesia is determined partly by its island structure and its position astride the Equator, which assure high, even temperatures. In addition, its location between the two landmasses of Asia and Australia exposes it to seasonal patterns of precipitation brought by monsoon winds.

        Regional temperature variation is a function of elevation rather than latitude. Temperatures are highest along the coast, where mean annual readings range from the mid-70s to the upper 80s °F (low 20s to low 30s °C).
      </p> 
      
      <p><strong>Cultural life</strong>
        <br>
        Indonesia exhibits a rich diversity of cultural practices and products. The remote interior regions of Sumatra, Kalimantan, and western New Guinea feature ritualized speech and local epic narrative traditions, while in Java and Bali the visual and performing arts are heavily influenced by the Hindu epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. In the cities, the mellifluous calls to prayer radiating from mosques, many of which display a markedly Muslim architectural style, coexist with the flashing lights and vibrant sounds of urban popular culture. These are just a few examples of Indonesia’s truly complex heritage.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>History</strong>
      <br>
        Remains of Homo erectus (originally called Pithecanthropus, or Java man) indicate that the ancestors of humans already inhabited the island of Java roughly 1.7 million years ago, when much of the western archipelago was still linked by land bridges. Some 6,000 years ago a rapid postglacial rise in sea level submerged these bridges. What remained was the largest island complex in the world: the Indonesian archipelago. Although records of foreign trade begin only in the early centuries CE, it is possible that people from the Indonesian archipelago were sailing to other parts of Asia much earlier. The Roman historian Pliny the Elder’s Natural History suggests that, in the 1st century CE, Indonesian outriggers were engaged in trade with the east coast of Africa. Indonesian settlements may have existed at that time in Madagascar, an island with distinct Indonesian cultural traits.

      <h3>
        Fall in love with Thailand
      </h3>
      
      <p><strong>Quick facts</strong>
      <br>
        Thailand, country located in the centre of mainland Southeast Asia. Located wholly within the tropics, Thailand encompasses diverse ecosystems, including the hilly forested areas of the northern frontier, the fertile rice fields of the central plains, the broad plateau of the northeast, and the rugged coasts along the narrow southern peninsula. 
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>Climate</strong>
      <br>
        The major influences on Thailand’s climate are its location in the tropical monsoon zone of mainland Southeast Asia and certain topographic features that affect the distribution of precipitation. Beginning in May, the warm, humid air masses of the southwest monsoon flow northeastward over the region from the Indian Ocean, depositing great quantities of precipitation; rainfall reaches a maximum in September. Between November and February the winds reverse direction, and the northeast monsoon brings cool, relatively dry air in a southwesterly flow to create cooler temperatures for much of the country. Stagnant air in March and April produces a distinct hot-and-dry intermonsoonal period.
      </p> 
      
      <p><strong>Cultural life</strong>
        <br>
        Prior to the modernizing reforms begun in the late 19th century under King Chulalongkorn, Thai cultural life revolved around the Siamese royal court and the wat, the Buddhist temple-monastery. Many ancient practices associated with the court and the wat have been transformed into elements of contemporary Thailand’s national heritage. The monarchy, through its participation in royal functions, state ceremonies, and popular festivals, plays an important role in nurturing and preserving this heritage. Many state functions, today often shown on television, begin with the king or other members of the royal family performing Buddhist rites. Certain Buddhist holy days have been recognized as national holidays. Among these are Visakha Puja, the festival celebrating the birth, enlightenment, and death of the Buddha, and the beginning and end of “Buddhist Lent” (phansa)—a three-month period corresponding to the monsoon season, during which both monks and laypeople give added attention to religious practices such as meditation.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>History</strong>
      <br>
        The Thai are descended from a much larger group of Tai-speaking peoples. The latter are found from extreme northeastern India in the west to northern Vietnam in the east and from southern China in the north to as far south as the central Malay Peninsula. In the past, scholars held that a parent group called the Proto-Tai originated in southern China and pushed south and west from the China landmass into northern mainland Southeast Asia. Most scholars now believe that the Tai came from northern Vietnam around the Dien Bien Phu area and that about 1,000 years ago they spread from there northward into southern China; westward into southwestern China, northern Myanmar (Burma), and northeastern India; and southward into what are now Laos and Thailand. For a discussion of Thai history in its regional context, see Southeast Asia, history of.
